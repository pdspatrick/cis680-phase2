Starting this a bit later than I wanted to. Problems with IntelliJ after a recent windows update - solution was at https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-238995 and involved abusing WinSock due to a change in HyperV (lolwut?). Why is windows TCP/IP still based on WinSock from Windows 95?
Also created the base templates in IntelliJ and uploaded to GitHub.

Frustrations with getting JavaFX (my chosen UI framework) to work in IntelliJ. I'm pretty sure I imported JavaFX in 4 different places, but it finally works! The sample application compiles and shows up. However, the scene builder within IntelliJ keeps crashing - I may have to use an external tool for this.

GOt code to compile, and managed to get the UI to execute code. It seems to hang somewhere and start eating tons of memory, I assume I screwed up something in either calculation or compiling the list. Hard stuff seems to be done though. Juist need to worry about storing the data, fixing calc issues, and rendering the charts
